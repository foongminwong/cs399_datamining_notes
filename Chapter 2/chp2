# Chapter 2: Training Decision Trees
2.1 Learning:
- an intuitive description of training in decision trees
- Task T, Experience E and Performance measure E

2.2 Preparing the Training Set
- Training set: data used to train the model
- 3 attributes of input data:(1) numeric (2) ordinal (categorical) (3) nominal

2.3 Training the Decision Tree
- It begins by finding the best horizontal split and the best vertical split
- decision stump: single node decision tree
- binary tree - amount of internal nodes (i.e. non-leaf nodes) equals the number of leaves minus 1.
- 


Questions:
1. Misclassification errors of horizontal split and vertical split in decision trees
2. Complicated decision trees might have a limited generalization capabilities,
