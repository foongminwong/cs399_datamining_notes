# Chapter 1: Introduction to Decision Trees
Four Layer Model:
- second layer in our four layers model is dedicated to the machine learning tasks, such as: Classification, Clustering, Anomaly Detection, Regression etc.

Taxomony of Data Mining Methods
- See the image

Supervised Methods
- prediction methods referred to as supervised learning

Decision tree:
- a predictive model which can be used to represent both classifiers and regression models
- a hierarchical model of decisions and consequences
- used for classification trees
- to analyze
- a classifier expressed as a recursive partition of the instance space.
- Internal nodes are represented as circles, whereas leaves are denoted as triangles
- ranges of values must be mutually exclusive and complete
- disjointness and completeness(ensure each data instance is mapped to one instance)
- tree complexity measured by (1) the total number of nodes (2) total number of leaves (3) tree depth (4)number of attributes used.


Classification Trees
- an exploratory technique
- classification trees are graphically represented as hierarchical structures
