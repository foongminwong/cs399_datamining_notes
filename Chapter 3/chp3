# Chapter 3: A Generic Algorithm for Top-Down Induction of Decision Trees
3.1 Training Set
- top-down inducing algorithm for decision tree
- (Training set size and classification accuracy are positively correlated) the predictive performance of a decision tree is expected to be poor if the training set used to train the model is too small.
- attributes/field/variable/feature - 2 types: (1) nominal (2) numeric

3.2 Definition of the Classification Problem
- 

3.3 Induction Algorithm
- an inducer (also known as learner), is an entity that obtains a training set and forms a model that generalizes the relationship between the input attributes and the target attribute.
- DT: decision tree inducer 
- DT(S): classification tree which was induced by performing DT on a training set S.
- DT(S)(xq): prediction 

3.4 Probability Estimation in Decision Trees
- tuple: a finite ordered list

3.4.1 Laplace Correction ?

3.4.2 No Match?

3.5 Algorithm Framework for Decision Trees
- Decision tree inducers are algorithms that automatically construct a decision tree from a given dataset
- goal is to find the optimal decision tree by minimizing the generalization error
- building the optimal decision tree from decision tables is known to be NP-hard
- constructing a minimal binary tree with respect to the expected number of tests required for classifying an unseen instance is NP-complete
- optimal decision tree algorithms is feasible only in small problems.
- heuristics methods are required for solving the problem
- CART stands for Classification and Regression Trees
